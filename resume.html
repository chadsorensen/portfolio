            <p>As a frontend developer, I love creating experiences that are intuitive, clean and fun. I thrive while working in small teams, collaborating closely with designers and backend developers and am comfortable being client facing. In my free time I like to snowboard, surf, camp, play pinball, bowl and spend time with my wife while we try to keep up with our daughter.</p>
